# satella.io
 satella.io is a software that brings life to illustrations.
We are currently operating it as a web service on satella.io (http://satella.io)

The release is planned for the 1st of february 2018 (01/02/2018) but since I want to learn proprely WebGL the release might be postponed.

I will keep updating the project for the sake of a good service.

* We use a old version of Electron for the beta release.

## The challenge to develop

Crafting and making an open source software that "brings life to illustrations" is the feel I had making this, it is a good experience.

I've learned 3D modeling techniques from scratch so it may seem rough but I hope that it brings me differents ways of making software.

satella.io is a web service which I will keep working on.

#### I expect that it evolves further.
